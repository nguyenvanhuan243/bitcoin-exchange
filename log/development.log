You are setting a key that conflicts with a built-in method OmniAuth::AuthHash::InfoHash#name defined at /home/huannguyen/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.1/gems/omniauth-1.2.2/lib/omniauth/auth_hash.rb:34. This can cause unexpected behavior when accessing the key as a property. You can still access the key via the #[] method.
DEPRECATION WARNING: Currently, Active Record suppresses errors raised within `after_rollback`/`after_commit` callbacks and only print them to the logs. In the next version, these errors will no longer be suppressed. Instead, the errors will propagate normally just like in other Active Record callbacks.

You can opt into the new behavior and remove this warning by setting:
